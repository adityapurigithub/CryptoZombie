          CryptoZombies is the largest education platform for blockchain

          CryptoZombies was the first tutorial on the internet for NFTs, and is
          still very relevant to the new crop of web3 developers looking to
          enter the industry today. Currently the CryptoZombies curriculum is
          mostly focused on Ethereum and Solidity development, but is a lot of
          demand for content targeting other chains such as Binance, TRON, and
          even projects like Chainlink.
